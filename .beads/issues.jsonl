{"id":"govtrack-2x5","title":"Design dependency and relationship system for issues","description":"Design and implement a dependency/relationship system inspired by Beads issue tracker.\n\n## Core Concepts from Beads\n\n### 1. Dependencies (Blocking Relationships)\n- Issue A **blocks** Issue B (B depends on A)\n- `govtrack dep add \u003cchild\u003e \u003cparent\u003e` - child depends on parent\n- Blocked issues can't be worked until blockers are resolved\n- `govtrack blocked` - show all blocked issues\n- `govtrack ready` - show issues with no open blockers\n\n### 2. Related Issues\n- Softer relationship than dependencies\n- \"See also\" connections between issues\n- Useful for duplicates, similar reports, related work\n- `govtrack relate \u003cissue1\u003e \u003cissue2\u003e`\n\n### 3. Parent-Child Hierarchies (Epics)\n- Issues can have sub-issues\n- Hierarchical IDs: gi-a1b2.1, gi-a1b2.2\n- Epic progress tracking (3/5 children closed)\n- `govtrack epic create \"Big Project\"`\n- `govtrack epic add-task \u003cepic-id\u003e \u003ctask-id\u003e`\n\n## Data Model Changes\n\nAdd to issue schema:\n```json\n{\n  \"depends_on\": [\"gi-xxxx\", \"gi-yyyy\"],\n  \"blocks\": [\"gi-zzzz\"],\n  \"related\": [\"gi-aaaa\"],\n  \"parent_id\": \"gi-bbbb\",\n  \"children\": [\"gi-cccc\", \"gi-dddd\"]\n}\n```\n\n## CLI Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `govtrack dep add \u003cissue\u003e \u003cdepends-on\u003e` | Add dependency |\n| `govtrack dep rm \u003cissue\u003e \u003cdepends-on\u003e` | Remove dependency |\n| `govtrack relate \u003cissue1\u003e \u003cissue2\u003e` | Link related issues |\n| `govtrack unrelate \u003cissue1\u003e \u003cissue2\u003e` | Unlink issues |\n| `govtrack blocked` | Show blocked issues |\n| `govtrack ready` | Show unblocked issues |\n| `govtrack show \u003cid\u003e` | Show deps in issue detail |\n\n## Web UI Changes\n\n- Issue detail page shows:\n  - \"Blocked by\" section with linked issues\n  - \"Blocks\" section  \n  - \"Related issues\" section\n- Visual dependency graph (nice to have)\n- Filter by blocked/ready status\n- Warning when closing issue that blocks others\n\n## Other Beads Features to Consider\n\n1. **Hash-based IDs** - Already implemented ✓\n2. **JSONL storage** - Already implemented ✓\n3. **History tracking** - Already implemented ✓\n4. **Semantic compaction** - Summarize old closed issues to save space\n5. **Sync/daemon** - Background sync with git\n6. **Prime context** - Inject relevant context at session start\n7. **Audit trail** - Track who changed what and when\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\nPhase 1: Dependencies (blocks/blocked-by)\nPhase 2: Related issues\nPhase 3: Parent-child hierarchies\nPhase 4: Ready/blocked filtering in CLI and web","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"piyushjha8164@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-16T22:56:31.168543-08:00","created_by":"Piyush Jha","updated_at":"2026-01-16T22:56:31.168543-08:00"}
